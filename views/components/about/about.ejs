<h3>The Native Token is the base currency of the Native Protocol. It is the unit of accounting to represent transactions within the Network. The transactions, and therefore the corresponding activity, is a transference of energy.

  <small>*We are building on Ethereum initially, so naturally we have an ETH based reserve. If it is indicated that we should move to another chain or live on multiple chains, we will rebuild Native there and spread the reserve across the chains.

      <br><br>
      Joining a Tribe within the Native Network simultaneously gives the individual power to decide where their money goes, while it remains in a stable environment backed by the Native Reserve.
      <br><br>
      The Native Reserve, is a liquidity pool represented by Native Token. Its value is supported initially by an Ether* reserve which grows with each person that joins the Network, and the activity in the Network which, unlike traditional banking systems, means your money is backed by you and your Tribe.
