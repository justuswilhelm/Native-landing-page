            <p class="short">
              Nathalie, an entertainment producer, wants to promote her organization's second annual music festival. She creates a Habitat called Festival Goers and uses the mailing list from last year’s festival to invite users to join. As the Habitat’s curator, Nathalie launches a Festival Goers token and sets a deadline date to raise 10,000 tokens, which will cover the festival’s performance costs. Nathalie incentivizes users to buy tokens by offering them free festival tickets if they buy a certain amount.
              After the goal is met, Contributors can use the tokens they initially put in as votes that select the festival’s performers. If a performer receives the amount of tokens needed to cover his performance cost, then Nathalie selects him for the festival. By the end of the campaign, 1,100 people received free festival tickets and 16 performers received enough tokens to perform.

            <p class="short">
          As the concept of building autonomous sea-dwelling communities gains widespread recognition, more people want to know how they can help bring this vision to life. Recognizing that many people want to contribute, but don’t know how, the two leading seasteading proponents create a Seasteaders Habitat to consolidate contributors, investors, and creators into a single digital community.
          Seasteading advocates use their native Habitat to secure a communal land trust and fund development. With Habitat’s streamlined voting mechanism, contributors can vote on proposals - like whether to first build apartments or a hospital - that help move the project forward. By combining Habitat’s tokenized economic model and community-based voting system, Seasteaders are able to prioritize the tasks that their community believes to be the most crucial.

            <p class="short">
            In the wake of one largest refugee crises in world history, it is hard to make sense of the staggering number of Syrian refugees and the tragic stories that haunt them. Those who want to help face a difficult question: How does one effectively allocate limited resources to benefit the most people? In the Syrian Aid Committee Habitat, philanthropists, scholars, activists, and contributors can come together to not only offer, but also implement solutions to this complex question.

            Ahmed, a renowned expert on the Syrian Refugee Crisis, is the curator of the Syrian Aid Committee. He selects the most promising project proposals to show to Contributors in the Habitat. One of the projects he selects manufactures easy-to-assemble houses that use passive cooling, harvest rainwater, and run on solar panels. The project creator hopes to send 50,000 of these homes to refugee camps in Jordan and Georgia, but first needs help covering the manufacturing and shipping expenses. The project creator works with Ahmed to calculate a cost projection and deadline date. Contributors in the Habitat see this goal and use their Native Tokens to buy tokens specific to this project. The project creator has raised enough tokens by the deadline and is able to manufacture sustainable housing for refugees.
