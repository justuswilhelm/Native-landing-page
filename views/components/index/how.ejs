    <h3>Native Network</h3>
    <div class="info">
    The Native Network is the total collective users and Tribes utilizing the Native Protocol. The opportunity to search through tribes and join only groups that are relevant empowers users to decide where their money goes, while it remains in a stable environment backed by the Native Reserve.
    </div>
    <br><br>
    <h3>Native Reserve</h3>
    <div class="info">
    The Native Reserve, is a liquidity pool represented by Native Token. Its value is supported by an Ether* reserve that grows with each person who joins the Network. Its price level is also determined by the activity in the Network which, unlike traditional banking systems, means your money is backed by you and your Tribe.
    </div>
    <br><br>
    <h3>Tribe Token</h3>
    <div class="info">
    Each tribe has a local currency known as a Tribe Token. This is a foundational component of the tools provided by the Native Protocol. When a Contributor finds a tribe to join, they stake (which essentially means allocate) enough Native Tokens to become a member. Tribe Tokens are generated at the market price and sent to the Contributor’s account. The market cap of a Tribe’s token is the value of the Tribe.
    </div>
    <br><br>
    <h3>Development Fund</h3>
    <div class="info">
    Funds that are not allocated to the local reserve to act as a currency’s liquidity pool are sent the to the Tribe Development Fund. The Tribe can lend and spend from the fund to execute goals. The amount of NT in the Development Fund, and the utilization of it, represents one component of the Tribe’s value. In other words, the Development Fund is like the bank, but you have a higher degree of control to what your money powers.

    *We are building on Ethereum initially, so naturally we have an ETH based reserve. If it is indicated that we should move to another chain or live on multiple chains, we will rebuild Native there and spread the reserve across the chains.

    <h4>Native Token
      <br><br>
    The Native Token is the base currency of the Native Protocol. It is the unit of accounting to represent transactions within the Network. Native Token holders are liquidity providers and are rewarded for supporting the network through its continued growth and contributions from Tribes.
